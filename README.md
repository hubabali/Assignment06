When I first did the manual UI testing using Playwright and Java, it was a long process, but I learned a lot
I had to manually figure out every step, like how to search for items, apply filters, and click through the checkout process.
It took time to get everything working because I had to test it over and over until it finally ran all the way through without breaking
Even though it was harder to build, the manual version ended up being very stable and ran smoothly each time.

When I tried using the AI-assisted method with the Playwright MCP agent, I thought it would be much easier since the AI wrote most of the code for me
It was cool seeing it generate the test just from a simple prompt, but I ran into a lot of problems. The AI script didn’t work right away
It used selectors that didn’t match the website, had timeout issues, and sometimes crashed halfway through. 
I had to go back and look at my original manual BookstoreTest to understand what was wrong.
I used it as a guide to fix the AI-generated version so it could follow the same steps correctly. 
Without my working manual test, I don’t think I would have been able to fix the AI version.
